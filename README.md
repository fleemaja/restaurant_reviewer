"Restaurant Reviewer" allows users to read & write reviews for restaurants.

The goal is to create an app that is empathetic to the needs of all users. It will work across browsers and devices. The app will be fully accessible to those who use screen readers, those who are color blind or lack visual acuity, and those who lack precise motor control.
